USAGE                                                               *RubyRunner*

:RunRuby                                                              *:RunRuby*

    Executes the contents of the current buffer (which may be unsaved) as
    Ruby code and outputs the results into a new buffer.

By default, |:RunRuby| is bound to <C-r> for buffers with a ruby filetype.

The output buffer gains focus, and you can use <C-r> again to close it.
You can also close it with q and the ordinary commands like |ZZ| and |:q|.

If you hold shift, <C-R> will keep focus in the input buffer. If you're in
input mode, you'll even stay in input mode. So you can keep hitting <C-R>
as you type, any time you have valid Ruby code.

One and the same output buffer is reused per tab page. This implies that you can
move the buffer around (e.g. change to a vertical split) and expect future
output to go to the same place as long as you don't close the output buffer.

CONFIGURATION                                          *RubyRunnerConfiguration*

This goes in ~/.vimrc.

To more easily set a ruby filetype (with ":FR"):

    command! FR set filetype=ruby

If you don't like the default mappings, define your own and the default ones
will not be added. Adapt these to your taste:

  if has("autocmd") && has("gui_macvim")

    " Unshifted
    au FileType ruby map  <buffer> <D-r>      :RunRuby<CR>
    au FileType ruby imap <buffer> <D-r> <Esc>:RunRuby<CR>

    " Shifted
    au FileType ruby map  <buffer> <D-R>      :RunRuby<CR> <C-w>w
    au FileType ruby imap <buffer> <D-R> <Esc>:RunRuby<CR> <C-w>wa

    " Close output buffer
    au FileType ruby-runner map <buffer> <D-r> ZZ

  endif

================================================================================
CAVEATS                                                      *RubyRunnerCaveats*

Requires MacVim with autocmd support for the default mappings to be defined.

Script execution does not wait for `gets`. The value of any `gets` will be nil.

Vim will be unresponsive while the script executes, and will only show the
output all at once after completion.
